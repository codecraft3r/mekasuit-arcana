## Development

Use Java 21 and Python 3. Gradle resolves the pinned compile-only dependencies
from Modrinth Maven:

```sh
./gradlew build runtimeTestJar
```

On Windows use `gradlew.bat`. The normal jar must not contain dependency or
runtime-harness classes. Keep changes scoped and include regression tests.

## Design constraints

- Bodyarmor only; mainhand Meka-Tool accepts Amplification and Focus only.
- Keep per-carrier caps, configuration, and FE accounts independent.
- Use Iron's existing mana, casting, and timers; no custom casting or spell storage.
- Insufficient FE removes bonuses without blocking ordinary casting.
- Do not commit dependency jars, game worlds, logs, tokens, or personal paths.

## Evidence

`gradlew test` checks loader-free logic. It does not boot Minecraft. See
[the runtime report](docs/RUNTIME_PROOF.md) for server integration coverage and
remaining client/full-pack checks. Never describe a compile or boot as gameplay
verification. Include exact mod versions when reporting a compatibility issue.
